<h1>VolumeControl</h1>

This product allows the user to control the volume of their Mac and perform operations to Spotify or to iTunes. If the user taps the left capacitive bar on the device, it will go to the previous song, the middle bar will pause/play, and the right bar will skip to the next song. Hovering a hand over the ultrasonic sensor will change the volume, and swiping over the sensor at a low height (< 8cm) will toggle mute. A single LED on the housing indicates whether the ultrasonic sensor is receiving data.
